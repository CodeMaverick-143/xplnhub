## Welcome

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **XplnHUB**! Whether you are fixing a bug, improving documentation, or proposing a new feature, this guide will help you get started quickly.

## Getting Started

- **Fork & clone** the repository to your local machine.
- **Install dependencies** using `npm install`.
- **Create a branch** for your work. Follow the pattern `type/short-description` (e.g. `feat/add-search`, `bugfix/fix-navbar`).

## Development Workflow

- Keep your branch in sync by pulling from `main` regularly.
- Run `npm run lint` before committing to catch style or formatting issues.
- Include screenshots or recordings for UI-related changes when possible.

## Coding Guidelines

- Follow the existing code style and project structure.
- Prefer TypeScript types and interfaces for new code.
- Keep components and functions focused; extract helpers when logic grows complex.

## Testing

- Add or update tests alongside your changes when applicable.
- Ensure the full test suite passes locally: `npm test`.

## Commit Messages

- Write concise, descriptive commit messages in the present tense.
- Reference related issues when relevant (e.g. `Fix button state toggle (#123)`).
