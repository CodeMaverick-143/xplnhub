   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

   Using pnpm:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**

   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add the following variables:

   ```env
   # API Configuration
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=your_api_url_here
   
   # Add other required environment variables
   # Example:
   # DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
   # NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_secret_key
   ```

   **Note:** Never commit your `.env.local` file to version control. An `.env.example` file is provided as a template.

4. **Run the development server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Or with yarn:
   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

   Or with pnpm:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

5. **Access the application**
